# pidgeon-detector

The problem is that I can't get rid of pidgeons on my balcony and need to wipe their stuff, including eggs and sticks.

I imagine I could solve it with pidgeon detector. This would use CUTTING EDGE AI to detect a pidgeon and send targeted poke at them. 

Initially I imagine this could be a bluetooth speaker, possibly some magic sounds that wouldn't annoy people, or something like mechanical arm poking them. This would allow people around the world to get rid of these ugly nets or fences.

## Approach

First thing is to collect at least three days (a week?) worth of photos from my balcony from different angles to get an idea on how much more data I need to teach algo what does it mean to have a pidgeon on your balcony.

Side effect of this photo labelling could be trying to collect data on their mating preferences, habits and so on. This bit of info would allow us to cut some ends (i.e. if they don't come at nights, turn costly algo off between 22 and 6).

Then, having nice datasets I should write simple program to tell yes/no pidgeon (% certain?) when given a photo of my balcony. Or some other photo.

## Philosophy

I want to brute force this process to understand how to work with AI 101 and what I'm missing. This should be accompanied by great reading, learning new tools and developing some opinions along the way.
